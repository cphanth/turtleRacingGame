Python in Trinket

I this lesson, I learned about establishing packages like turtle() and random() as well as how to create isntances of Turtle().
I also learned about for loops/patterns, picking up and down of the pen, writing text, and how to use ranges for for loops.
goto() is another function I learned to place my object in specific areas.
This was a cool project for an introduction to Python and working with Trinket!
